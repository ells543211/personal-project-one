For my project, my python mentor went through the lesson and guided me as I coded this worm. We used this lesson: 
https://docs.replit.com/tutorials/19-build-snake-with-pygame
I was proud how I was barely needed the starter code to complete my project especially with the movement function and keys pressed function
as i ran my project a few errors appeared and after a day of trying to figure whats wrong, my mentor helped me and guided me with the food but i eventually got it
I hope in the future to construct my own idea that has not already been coded by someone else so i can completely explore my creativity 
A challenge I had was importiung the files into the main file but that was easily fixed as I was reminded of the simple import function
