Ellee: In this project, I declared variables for the snake. I also declared classes for the food. I addiitonally used an if statement for assigning typing the keys to a function, a nd deturmining what to do after the snake hits the grid,. Additionally, I created functions in which I worked with user interaction in adding different keys to move the snake while avodiing the boundires and obsticles. Overall I really enjoyed coding this project and expiramenting with errors such as they pattern and the user interaction not working properly.
